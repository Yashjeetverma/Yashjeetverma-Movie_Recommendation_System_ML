# Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This movie recommendation system helps users find movies they might enjoy based on their preferences. It uses a machine learning algorithm, specifically cosine similarity, to suggest movies similar to a user's favorite films. The system is designed for movie enthusiasts who want personalized recommendations without manually browsing through a large catalog of movies.

This movie recommendation system leverages a dataset from Kaggle and is built using Python. It utilizes libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to process data and compute similarities between movies. The TfidfVectorizer helps convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors, allowing the cosine similarity algorithm to find closely related films. It is ideal for anyone looking to enhance their viewing experience by discovering new movies tailored to their tastes, with potential applications in streaming platforms and entertainment websites.
